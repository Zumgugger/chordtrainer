Chord Trainer
=============

Single-file web app to practice naming chord notes.

How to use
- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into browser).
- Choose a root, quality and mode (3rd / 5th / 7th / All notes).
- Click note names to select them, then press `Check`.
- Progress is stored in your browser's `localStorage`.

Notes
- Roots include both `F#` and `Gb` variants, and the usual circle-of-fifths keys.
- Default chord qualities: Major, Minor, Dominant 7, Major 7, Minor 7, Diminished.
- Notation: keys that use flats show flat spellings, sharp keys show sharps.

If you want more features (keyboard shortcuts, additional chord types, or a server-based sync), tell me and I'll extend the app.
